Projects in C++ and Mathematica regarding numerical modeling of geometrical objects

The first program, 'Circle-Segment_Intersection.cpp' calculates the number of points of intersection for a circle and a segment on a plane. It takes an input from file, which consists of 7 real numbers (type double): coordinates of the circle centre (2 numbers), radius of the circle and coordinates of the left and right ends of the segment (2 pairs of numbers, respectively).

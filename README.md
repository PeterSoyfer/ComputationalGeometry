Projects in C++ and Mathematica regarding numerical modeling of geometrical objects

The first two programs, 'Circle-Segment_Intersection.cpp' and 'Circle-Segment_Intersect.py' calculate the number of points of intersection for a circle and a segment on a plane. It takes an input from file, which consists of 7 real numbers (type double): coordinates of the circle centre (2 numbers), radius of the circle and coordinates of the left and right ends of the segment (2 pairs of numbers, respectively). Python version handles the exceptions with potential overflow and underflow issues.
